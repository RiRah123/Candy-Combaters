Candy Combaters is a two-player candy-themed game where each player controls their character using the keyboard and fights their opponent in a brawl to the death. The game features custom characters, scenery design, and sprite animation that is relevant to the candy theme and street fighter genre.

## Instructions to Play the Game
Players must choose a difficulty level for gameplay to begin. In easy mode, there is no game timer, but for medium and hard mode, players have a limited amount of time to defeat their opponent. Specifically, 30 seconds will be provided on medium mode, and 20 seconds on hard mode. Once a difficulty mode has been chosen, characters are dropped into the game. The character on the left side of the screen is assigned to player 1. The character can move right or left using the A and D keys, jump using W, and attack using S. Likewise, the character on the right side of the screen is assigned to player 2, and its controls are the arrow buttons on the keyboard. Player 2's character can move right or left using the right and left arrow keys, jump using the up arrow key, and attack using the down arrow key. While playing the game, a health bar is located at the top screen, indicating the amount of health for each player. A player wins the game if they are able to drain their opponent's health to 0. If the timer runs out and no player has died, the winner will be whoever has the most health by the end of the game. If both players have the same amount of health, the game ends in a tie. Once the game is complete, a countdown timer will appear indicating the time left until the next game starts. After the timer reaches 0, the game will reload, bringing both players back to the start screen.

## Next Steps for Candy Combaters

Further improvements we could add to the game include:

- Adding different playable character options for each player to choose from
- Expanding the fighting mechanics to include higher strength fighting combos
- Diversifying the range of attacks each character is able to make
- Adding climbable surfaces to the stage for a varied game experience
- Adding a defensive mechanism, where characters can block enemy attacks
- Creating a variety of stages and backdrops
- Adding a loot system, where the player earns rewards after winning a game and can upgrade their characters using those rewards
